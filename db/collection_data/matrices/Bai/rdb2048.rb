    notes: 'This matrix (Bai/rdb2048) is the same as the original NEP RDB2048L
matrix (as of Nov 2006).  Either the name changed since 1996 and  
the L was added in the NEP collection, or the L was dropped when  
the matrix as added to the UF Sparse Matrix Collection in 1996.   
The name cannot be corrected here without disrupting the UF Sparse
Matrix Collection.  To make matters worse, there is now a matrix  
in the NEP collection with the name RDB2048, as of Nov 2006.  The 
NEP RDB2048 matrix was added to this collection in Nov 2006, as   
Bai/rdb2038_noL matrix.
