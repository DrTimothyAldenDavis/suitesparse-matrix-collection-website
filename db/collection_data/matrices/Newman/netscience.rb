The graph netscience contains a coauthorship network of scientists         
working on network theory and experiment, as compiled by M. Newman in May  
2006.  The network was compiled from the bibliographies of two review      
articles on networks, M. E. J. Newman, SIAM Review 45, 167-256 (2003) and  
S. Boccaletti et al., Physics Reports 424, 175-308 (2006), with a few      
additional references added by hand.  The version given here contains all  
components of the network, for a total of 1589 scientists, and not just the
largest component of 379 scientists previously published.  The network is  
weighted, with weights assigned as described in M. E. J. Newman,           
Phys. Rev. E 64, 016132 (2001).
