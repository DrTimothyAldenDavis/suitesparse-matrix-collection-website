Neural network of the nematode C. Elegans                                  
                                                                           
Compiled by Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz from original experimental    
data by White et al.                                                       
                                                                           
The graph celegansneural describes a weighted, directed network            
representing the neural network of C. Elegans.  The data were taken from   
the web site of Prof. Duncan Watts at Columbia University,                 
http://cdg.columbia.edu/cdg/datasets.  The nodes in the original data were 
not consecutively numbered, so they have been renumbered to be consecutive.
The original node numbers from Watts\' data file are retained as the labels 
of the nodes.  Edge weights are the weights given by Watts.
