The following are relevant excerpts from lp/data/readme (by David M. Gay):    
                                                                              
The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude      
slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include         
the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first          
right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the            
MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each       
line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent        
mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates       
whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for "has bounds", R         
for "has ranges".                                                             
                                                                              
The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)                   
running on a VAX with default options.

* Objective  is the first row of type N.  It is minimized except as shown.    
                                                                              
* Itns       is the number of iterations required to solve the problem        
             by the primal simplex method, as implemented in the Fortran      
             code MINOS 5.0 (May 1985), using default values for all          
             parameters.  (The initial basis is triangular.)                  
                                                                              
* Time       is the processor time required on an IBM 3081K.  The MINOS       
             source code was compiled with the IBM Fortran 77 compiler        
             VS FORTRAN, using the options NOSDUMP, NOSYM and OPT(3).
