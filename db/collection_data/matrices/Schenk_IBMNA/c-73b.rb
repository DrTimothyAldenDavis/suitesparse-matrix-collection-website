An earlier version (Oct. 2003) of this matrix was obtained from Olaf   
Schenk, and appears here as Schenk_IBMNA/c-73.  However, it differs    
from the version posted on his web site as of Nov. 2006.   The new     
version appears here as Schenk_IBMNA/c-73b.   The two matrices are very
similar, but not identical.
