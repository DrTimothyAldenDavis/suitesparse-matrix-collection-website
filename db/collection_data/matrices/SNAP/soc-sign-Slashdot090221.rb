Slashdot is a technology-related news website know for its specific user       
community. The website features user-submitted and editor-evaluated current    
primarily technology oriented news. In 2002 Slashdot introduced the Slashdot   
Zoo feature which allows users to tag each other as friends or foes. The       
network cotains friend/foe links between the users of Slashdot. The network was
obtained in February 2009.
