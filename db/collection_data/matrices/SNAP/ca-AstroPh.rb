Arxiv ASTRO-PH (Astro Physics) collaboration network is from the e-print arXiv
and covers scientific collaborations between authors papers submitted to Astro
Physics category. If an author i co-authored a paper with author j, the graph 
contains a undirected edge from i to j. If the paper is co-authored by k      
authors this generates a completely connected (sub)graph on k nodes.          
                                                                              
The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124     
months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus
represents essentially the complete history of its ASTRO-PH section.
