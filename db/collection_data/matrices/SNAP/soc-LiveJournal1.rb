LiveJournal is a free on-line community with almost 10 million members; a      
significant fraction of these members are highly active. (For example, roughly 
300,000 update their content in any given 24-hour period.) LiveJournal allows  
members to maintain journals, individual and group blogs, and it allows people 
to declare which other members are their friends they belong.
