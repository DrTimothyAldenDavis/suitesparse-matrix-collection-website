High Energy Physics - Phenomenology collaboration network

Arxiv HEP-PH (High Energy Physics - Phenomenology) collaboration network is    
from the e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between authors    
papers submitted to High Energy Physics - Phenomenology category. If an author 
i co-authored a paper with author j, the graph contains a undirected edge from 
i to j. If the paper is co-authored by k authors this generates a completely   
connected (sub)graph on k nodes.                                               
                                                                               
The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124      
months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus 
represents essentially the complete history of its HEP-PH section.
