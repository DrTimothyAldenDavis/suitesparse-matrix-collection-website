Nodes represent pages from University of Notre Dame (domain nd.edu) and       
directed edges represent hyperlinks between them. The data was collected in   
1999 by Albert, Jeong and Barabasi.

NOTE: a similar version of this problem already appears in the UF Collection:

                    in Barabasi/:   n: same      nz:   929,849                
                                                                              
                    The Barabasi/NotreDame_www is an exact copy of            
                    the graph of that name in the Pajek data set.             
                    The SNAP collection has a different version of this       
                    graph, of which SNAP/web-NotreDame is an exact copy.      
                    It is possible that Barabasi\'s version of the graph is yet
                    a 3rd version of this graph.
