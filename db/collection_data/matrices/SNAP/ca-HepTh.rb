High Energy Physics - Theory collaboration network                             
                                                                               
Dataset information                                                            
                                                                               
Arxiv HEP-TH (High Energy Physics - Theory) collaboration network is from the  
e-print arXiv and covers scientific collaborations between authors papers      
submitted to High Energy Physics - Theory category. If an author i co-authored 
a paper with author j, the graph contains a undirected edge from i to j. If the
paper is co-authored by k authors this generates a completely connected        
(sub)graph on k nodes.                                                         
                                                                               
The data covers papers in the period from January 1993 to April 2003 (124      
months). It begins within a few months of the inception of the arXiv, and thus 
represents essentially the complete history of its HEP-TH section.
