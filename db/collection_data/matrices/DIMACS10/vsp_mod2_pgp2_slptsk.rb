Each graph in this benchmark represents a star-like structure of     
different graphs S0 , . . . , St. Graphs S1 , . . . , St are weakly  
connected to the center S0 by random edges. The total number of edges
between each Si and S0 was less than 3% out of the total number of   
edges in Si . The graphs are mixtures of the following structures:   
social networks, finite-element graphs, VLSI chips, peer-to-peer     
networks, and matrices from optimization solvers.
