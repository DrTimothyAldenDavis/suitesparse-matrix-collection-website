This graph has been obtained from the 2001 crawl performed by the        
WebBase crawler. The data provided by WebBase has been filtered to       
eliminate invalid links and to normalise URLs. The experiments           
reported in reports "The WebGraph Framework I: Compression               
Techniques" and "Codes for the World-Wide Web", (both at                 
http://law.di.unimi.it/ ) are based on this graph and on                 
uk-2002. Note that for historical reasons the URLs of this               
graph are coded in ISO-8859-1.
