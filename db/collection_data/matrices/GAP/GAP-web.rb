In that paper, the Web graph is described as follows:                
                                                                     
    Web (|V|=50.6M, |E|=1,949.4M, directed) is a web-crawl of the    
    .sk domain (sk-2005) [9].  Despite its large size, it exhibits   
    substantial locality due to its topology and high average        
    degree.

    "This graph has been obtained from a 2005 crawl of the .sk       
    domain performed by UbiCrawler for a group of Slovakian          
    researchers. An interesting feature of this crawl is that we     
    were provided a very large seed."                                
                                                                     
    For additional graph properties and statistics, including node   
    labels, see http://law.di.unimi.it/webdata/sk-2005               
                                                                     
The graph already appears in the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection as    
LAW/sk-2005, but this GAP/GAP-web version is slightly different.     
                                                                     
The number of nodes differs by three.  In the original LAW/sk-2005   
graph, with 50,636,154 nodes, the last three nodes of the graph have 
no edges at all.  These have been dropped from the GAP/GAP-web       
graph.  The LAW graph includes 19,119,653 self-edges, but the        
GAP/GAP-web graph discards these.  Finally, the LAW/sk-2005 graph is 
binary, but the GAP/GAP-web graph adds random edge weights.  That is:
                                                                     
    Prob1 = ssget (\'LAW/sk-2005\') ;                                  
    Prob2 = ssget (\'GAP/GAP-web\') ;                                  
    A1 = Prob1.A ;                                                   
    A2 = Prob2.A ;                                                   
                                                                     
    % the LAW/sk-2005 graph is binary                                
    assert (isequal (A1, spones (A1))) ;                             
                                                                     
    % discard diagonal entries from LAW/sk-2005, and last 3 nodes    
    S1 = tril (A1, -1) + triu (A1,1) ;                               
    S1 = S1 (1:end-3, 1:end-3) ;                                     
                                                                     
    % discard the edge weights from GAP/GAP-web                      
    S2 = spones (A2) ;                                               
                                                                     
    % now the graphs are identical:                                  
    assert (isequal (S1, S2))                                        
                                                                     
The original graph is from the Laboratory for Web Algorithmics       
(LAW), Universita degli Studi di Milano,                             
http://law.di.unimi.it/index.php .                                   
                                                                     
It was added to the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection by Tim Davis,      
from the original LAW data, as the LAW/sk-2005 matrix.  It was       
then incorporated from there into the GAP benchmark suite by         
Scott Beamer, Krste Asanovic\', and David Patternson, with random     
edge weights added, based on the version of the graph at             
https://sparse.tamu.edu/LAW/sk-2005.  Finally, the new GAP graph     
has been re-imported back into the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection,    
as the GAP/GAP-web graph.  This is to preserve the random edge       
weights and source nodes added by S. Beamer et al., so that the GAP  
benchmark can be fully replicated in the SuiteSparse Matrix          
Collection.                                                          
                                                                     
The GAP breadth-first-search (BFS) benchmark generates 64 random     
source nodes and evaluates the time to compute the BFS from each of  
the 64 sources.  The betweenness-centrality (BC) runs 16 trials with 
4 source nodes each.  These source nodes are the same, in the same   
order.  That is, the first 4 BFS source nodes are the same 4 source  
nodes for the first trial of BC.  In one-based notation (where nodes 
are numbered 1 to n), the 64 source nodes are:

These node ids also appear as Problem.aux.sources, in one-based

(such as the GAP benchmark itself, or the C API to GraphBLAS), be    
sure to subtract one from the node ids above (and in                 
Problem.aux.sources) to obtain the right source nodes.
