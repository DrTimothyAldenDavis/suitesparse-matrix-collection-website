Problem description: Geomechanical problem                      
                                                                
The matrix Emilia_923 is obtained from a structural problem     
discretizing a gas reservoir with tetrahedral Finite Elements.  
Due to the complex geometry of the geological formation it was  
not possible to obtain a computational grid characterized by    
regularly shaped elements.  The problem arises from a 3D        
discretization with three displacement unknowns associated to   
each node of the grid.  Some further information may be found in
the following papers:
