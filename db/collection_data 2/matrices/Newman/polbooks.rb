Nodes represent books about US politics sold by the online bookseller     
Amazon.com.  Edges represent frequent co-purchasing of books by the same  
buyers, as indicated by the "customers who bought this book also bought   
these other books" feature on Amazon.                                     
                                                                          
Nodes have been given values "l", "n", or "c" to indicate whether they are
"liberal", "neutral", or "conservative".  These alignments were assigned  
separately by Mark Newman based on a reading of the descriptions and      
reviews of the books posted on Amazon.
