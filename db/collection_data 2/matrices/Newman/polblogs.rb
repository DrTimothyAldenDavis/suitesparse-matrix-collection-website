Political blogosphere Feb. 2005                                            
Data compiled by Lada Adamic and Natalie Glance                            
                                                                           
Node "value" attributes indicate political leaning according to:           
                                                                           
  0 (left or liberal)                                                      
  1 (right or conservative)                                                
                                                                           
Data on political leaning comes from blog directories as indicated.  Some  
blogs were labeled manually, based on incoming and outgoing links and posts
around the time of the 2004 presidential election.  Directory-derived      
labels are prone to error; manual labels even more so.                     
                                                                           
Links between blogs were automatically extracted from a crawl of the front 
page of the blog.
