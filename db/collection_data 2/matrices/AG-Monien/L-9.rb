http://www2.cs.uni-paderborn.de/fachbereich/AG/monien/RESEARCH/PART/graphs.html
                                                                               
A collection of test graphs from various sources.  Many of the graphs          
include XY or XYZ coordinates.  This set also includes some graphs from        
the Harwell-Boeing collection, the NASA matrices, and some random matrices     
which are not included here in the AG-Monien/ group of the UF Collection.      
In addition, two graphs already appear in other groups:                        
                                                                               
   AG-Monien/big : same as Nasa/barth5, Pothen/barth5 (not included here)      
   AG-Monien/cage_3_11 : same as Pajek/GD98_c (included here)                  
                                                                               
The AG-Monien/GRID subset is not included.  It contains square grids that      
are already well-represented in the UF Collection.                             
                                                                               
Six of the problem sets are included as sequences, each sequence being         
a single problem instance in the UF Collection:
