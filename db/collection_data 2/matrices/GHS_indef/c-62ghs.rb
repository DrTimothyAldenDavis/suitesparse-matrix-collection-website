A version of this matrix was first obtained from Olaf Schenk in October
2003.  That version appears in this collection as Schenk_IBMNA/c-62.   
In August 2004, a new version appeared in the GHS collection, under the
same name, and was added here as GHS_indef/c-62ghs.  The c-62ghs matrix
is the same as the version on Schenk\'s web site as of Nov 2006, except 
that the right-hand-side was missing in the version in the UF Sparse   
Matrix Collection (now included).  The two matrices c-62 and c-62ghs   
are very similar, but not identical.
