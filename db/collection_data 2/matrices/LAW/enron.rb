This dataset was made public by the Federal Energy Regulatory            
Commission during its investigations: it is a partially                  
anonymised corpus of e-mail messages exchanged by some Enron             
employees (mostly part of the senior management). We turned              
this dataset into a directed graph, whose nodes represent                
people and with an arc from x to y whenever y was the                    
recipient of (at least) a message sent by x.
