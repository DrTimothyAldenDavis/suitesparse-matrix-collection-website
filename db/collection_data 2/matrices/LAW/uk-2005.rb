This graph has been obtained from a 2005 crawl of the .uk                
domain performed by UbiCrawler. The crawl was very shallow,              
and aimed at gathering a large number of hosts, but a small              
number of pages from each host. Note that before April 2006              
the URL order was not exactly lexicographical due to some                
locale issues (the graph was anyway correct). The current                
dataset has been correctly permuted so that URLs are ordered             
lexicographically.
