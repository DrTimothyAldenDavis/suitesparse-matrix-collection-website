Wikipedia is a free encyclopedia written collaboratively by volunteers around  
the world. Each registered user has a talk page, that she and other users can  
edit in order to communicate and discuss updates to various articles on        
Wikipedia. Using the latest complete dump of Wikipedia page edit history (from 
January 3 2008) we extracted all user talk page changes and created a network. 
                                                                               
The network contains all the users and discussion from the inception of        
Wikipedia till January 2008. Nodes in the network represent Wikipedia users and
a directed edge from node i to node j represents that user i at least once     
edited a talk page of user j.
