 High Energy Particle Physics (HEP) literature with May 12, 2003 Update       
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------       
 Citation data from KDD Cup 2003, a knowledge discovery and data mining       
 competition held in conjunction with the Ninth Annual ACM SIGKDD Conference. 
   http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/kddcup/index.html                       
 The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center SPIRES-HEP database has been          
 comprehensively cataloguing the High Energy Particle Physics (HEP) literature
 online since 1974, and indexes more than 500,000 high-energy physics related 
 articles including their full citation tree.                                 
 The network contains a citation graph of the hep-th portion of the arXiv.    
 The units names are the arXiv IDs of papers; the relation is  X cites Y .    
 Note that revised papers may have updated citations. As such, citations may  
 refer to future papers, i.e. a paper may cite another paper that was publishe
 after the first paper.

 The SLAC/SPIRES dates for all hep-th papers are given. Some older papers were
 uploaded years after their intial publication and the arXiv submission date  
 from the abstracts may not correspond to the publication date. An alternative
 date has been provided from SLAC/SPIRES that may be a better estimate        
 for the initial publication of these old papers.                             
 The vector contains the year in SLAC date of each paper.
