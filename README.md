A web interface for the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection, formerly known as the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection. It is currently deployed at [https://sparse.tamu.edu](https://sparse.tamu.edu).

## Features and Functionality

The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection web application provides a variety of features to help the scientific computing community access the Collection more easily.

### Matrix Property Search, Sorting, and Filtering

The SuiteSparse Matrix Collection web application allows real-time filtering by the following matrix properties:

#### Matrix Size and Shape
  - **Rows** - The number of rows in the matrix.
  - **Columns** - The number of columns in the matrix.
  - **Nonzeros** - The number of nonzero entries in the matrix.

#### Matrix Structure and Entry Type
  - **Pattern symmetry** - The percent of entries that are mirrored across the matrix diagonal. The numeric value of the entries is irrelevant.
  - **Numerical symmetry** - The percent of entries that are mirrored across the matrix diagonal with the identical numeric value.
  - **Number of strongly connected components** - The number of strongly connected components present in the resulting graph of this sparse matrix.
  - **Rutherford-Boeing type** - The type of entry in the sparse matrix. One of either Real, Complex, Integer, or Binary.
  - **Structure** - Special matrix structure, including square, rectangular, symmetric, skew-symmetric, Hermitian, and unsymmetric.
  - **Positive definiteness**

#### Matrix Metadata
  - **Matrix name** - The specific name of the matrix.
  - **Matrix group** - The group name the matrix belongs to.
  - **Matrix ID** - The numeric identification number of the matrix.
  - **Matrix Year** - The year the matrix was added to the Collection.

Additionally, matrix details are displayed on each matrix's individual page, including the matrix's rank, condition number, and information regarding its singular value decomposition. A variety of visualizations are also presented, including sparsity patterns, force-directed graph (or bipartite graph) visualizations (courtesy of Yifan Hu), Dulmage-Mendelsohn permuted sparsity patterns, and singular values plotted in decreasing size.

### Quick Access via URL Routing

Matrices can also be quickly accessed by URL route matching using the following URL routes:

 * **Group name** and **matrix name** to go directly to a matrix page
    * `https://sparse.tamu.edu/<Group Name>/<Matrix Name>`
    * [https://sparse.tamu.edu/HB/west0479](https://sparse.tamu.edu/HB/west0479)
 * **Matrix ID number** to go directly to a matrix page
    * `https://sparse.tamu.edu/<Matrix ID>`
    * [https://sparse.tamu.edu/1230](https://sparse.tamu.edu/1230) redirects to [https://sparse.tamu.edu/GHS_indef/copter2](https://sparse.tamu.edu/GHS_indef/copter2)
 * **Group name** to go directly to a group information page
    * `https://sparse.tamu.edu/<Group Name>`
    * [https://sparse.tamu.edu/Mycielski](https://sparse.tamu.edu/Mycielski)

## Bugs and Feature Requests

Find a problem with the website? Report it as an [Issue](https://github.com/ScottKolo/suitesparse-matrix-collection-website/issues), or suggest a fix via a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ScottKolo/suitesparse-matrix-collection-website/pulls).

## Building Locally

While the canonical deployment can be found at [https://sparse.tamu.edu](https://sparse.tamu.edu), you may wish to deploy a version of the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection website locally for testing or convenience. 

The only dependencies for running the application are listed below. They can be installed using your package manager (like `apt-get` or `yum` for Linux or `brew` for macOS):

 * Ruby 2.5 or later
 * PostgreSQL 8.4 or later

For running the test suite, the following additional dependencies are required:

 * PhantomJS 2.1.1 or later

The application is a standard Ruby on Rails web application, and can be installed with the following commands:

```shell
ruby -v                              # Check that Ruby 2.5+ is installed
git clone https://github.com/ScottKolo/suitesparse-matrix-collection-website.git
cd suitesparse-matrix-collection-website
gem install bundler:1.16.6           # Dependency manager
bundle install --without production  # Download and install dependencies
bundle exec rake db:setup            # Generate and seed the database
bundle exec rails server             # Start the Ruby on Rails server application
```

Once the Rails server starts, you can navigate to localhost:3000 to view the web application running locally.

## Test Suite

After building and running the applicaiton locally, you can run the test suite by running

```shell
bundle exec rake
```

This will run a variety of Cucumber, rspec, and Brakeman tests that ensure the backend and user interface frontend function correctly, and that no (obvious) security issues exist. It will also report test coverage, with a detailed report generated in the `/coverage` directory.
